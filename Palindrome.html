<h2>Largest Palindrome Product of two 3-digit numbers</h2>

<p> A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99. </p>

<h2>Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.</h2>
 <p> The parseInt() function parses a string and returns an integer. </p>
 <p> The toString() method returns a boolean value as a string. <p>
 <p> The split() method is used to split a string into an array of substrings, and returns the new array. Tip: If an empty string ("") is used as the separator, the string is split between each character.</p>
 <p>The reverse() method reverses an array in place. The first array element becomes the last and the last becomes the first. </p>
 <p>The join() method joins all elements of an array into a string.</p>
 <p> So</p>
